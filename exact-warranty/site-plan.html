			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of the website is to explain the positives of working with a warranty expert. The website will highlight the achievements that I 
            have made while being a Warranty Administrator for Ford and GM. It will also give peice of mind to potential clients on working with an offsite warranty administrator.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This would be any car dealership that is looking to streamline their warranty process while also hitting specific metrics put on them by the manufacturer of their brand.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Elements that will be dynamic will be a form. This will have the potential client choose or indicate which Dealer Management System (DMS) they use as well as choose what brand
            of dealership they are. This will also give a typical "onboarding" time frame depending on the brand and DMS.

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>The hardest part of the warranty process is making sure that it qualifies all of the different requirements that each manufacturer needs. Once the technician has completed
            repairs and returns the work order to the service advisor that is where we take over. We will review the work order, the technican comments, and punch times. We will then verify
            that all applicable labor operations were used. For those brands that are required additional checks for the work order will be done.
            
            <p>We commit to make sure that each work order is looked at, audited and then submitted within three days of being sent to us. If there are any work orders that do not meet requirements
            to be submitted we will be in contact with your service department within six business hours.</p>
            
            <p>We also commit to working closely with service and parts. Our goal is to grow with the business and communicate effectively with each department. We know that the key to a quick claims
            process is communication. Without proper communication things are missed and claims are stuck in review for too long.</p>

            <p>I would really like to put the different logos from Ford, GM, Toyota, etc. here but I believe I need to ask permission to do that. This can be something that we can discuss. If I cannot
            I will just put a generic car silhouette as the additional image.</p>
            </p>
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>This content will be comprised mostly of a contact form as described above. There will also be the logo and if possible the Ford, GM, etc. logos. If not, I will revert to the 
            car silhouette.</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>

			<img src="images/Main Page.png" alt="Home Page Wireframe" />

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
